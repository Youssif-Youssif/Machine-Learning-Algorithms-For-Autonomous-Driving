# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-For-Autonomous-Driving
The primary aim of this project was to attain a thorough comprehension of the operational principles employed in autonomous navigation, leveraging machine learning techniques and other software applications, including RViz and Gazebo, on a mobile robot integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS). My focus was on creating and implementing a lane detection algorithm that would successfully identify and highlight lanes on the road during real time navigation using a camera and feeding the frames into the algorithm, which was constructed using Python and OpenCV. 

In addition, I had also worked with the LiDAR sensor, which was used to create a virtual environment of the robots surrounding. This map was used to identify the robotâ€™s initial position, and Rviz was used to set way points to a desired and set destination, which the robot would follow by calculating the quickest path while avoiding obstacles perceived by the LiDAR sensor.
